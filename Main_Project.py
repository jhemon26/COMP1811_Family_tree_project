Jahid Emon & Hugo Piper's work.
Family tree project 1.
Paradigms of Programming
26/10/2024

PROGRESS:
- Family tree created in Lucidchart with names, relationships and DOB's. Jahid Emon & Hugo Piper
- The family tree has been implemented into the program in the form of a list. Hugo Piper
- FEATURE 1 COMPLETE: Basic family tree query structure: The program is able to retrieve specific data from a family members when a user enters a family members name: DOB, Parents, Grandparents, Children & Grandchildren. Programmed by Hugo

TODO:Implement a system where the user can select what family members they would like to view (close family, distant family (uncles, cousins...etc)), Feature 2a, Feature 2b, Feature 2c, Feature 3a, Feature 3b
